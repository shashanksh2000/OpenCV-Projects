# OpenCV-Projects
It includes 6 mini projects of OpenCV that gives the basic understanding of OpenCV.

## Prerequisites
Only thing required to run them is an IDE that supports jupyter notebooks. 
I use anaconda that comes with jupyter notebook and other good tools, you can also use VSCode with jupyter notebook extension.
