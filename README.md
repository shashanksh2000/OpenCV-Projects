# OpenCV-Projects
It includes 6 mini projects of OpenCV that gives the basic understanding of OpenCV.

## Prerequisites
Only thing required to run them is an IDE that supports jupyter notebooks. 
I use anaconda that comes with jupyter notebook and other good tools, you can also use VSCode with jupyter notebook extension.

Detects the different contours present in an image taking its shape as a parameter to compare.

## Counting Circles and Ellipses
Uses Contours detection to count circles and ellipses and groups them seperately.

## Finding waldo
It detects the most similar portion of the given image with the test image.

## Object Detection using SIFT & ORB
Detects different different objects in an image using SIFT & ORB.

## Car & Pedestrian Detection
It detects the cars and pedestrians in an image/video using the haarcascade classifiers.
